A LINQ to Entities query is built from the entity collection properties of the DbSet<T> type 
exposed by the context, and it consists of an IQueryable<T> implementation.

Execution of LINQ queries is deferred until GetEnumerator is invoked, 
which occurs in a foreach loop
or when a terminal operator such as ToList, ToArray, ToDictionary, 
Any, Count, LongCount, Single, SingleOrDefault, First, FirstOrDefault, Last, or LastOrDefault is used. 
You can pick up this query and start adding restrictions such as paging or sorting.
